# Siren_detection_with_ANN

### Is's a college mini porject done by group of three people including myself.

We trained a model for audio classification which uses normalised mfcc features to training and predictions

### We have done ANN model rather than a CNN model for two reason
  1: CNN models are very complex and hard to train and it takes a lot of time and computing power <br>
  2: Where for ANN a single vector of fecatures is enough for the training and prediction and it is the fatstest of two 


### On accuracy CNN has the upper hand but as for our Siren dectection ANN does the job pretty well.
